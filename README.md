# Schema Validation Utilities

The `schema-utils` library is used by several [OGC](http://www.opengeospatial.org/) 
conformance test suites. It provides support for validating XML representations 
using the following schema languages: 

* W3C XML Schema 1.0
* Schematron (ISO/IEC 19757-3:2006)
* RELAX NG (ISO/IEC 19757-2:2008)
